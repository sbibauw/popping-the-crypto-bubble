> “My dad got a job straight out of high school, saved up, and bought a house in his 20s,” said Anne Dakota, a 21-year-old receptionist from Asheville, North Carolina, who earns minimum wage. “I don’t even think that’s possible for me, at least with the current money I make.”

> I think this is pretty much the whole story. It’s very hard to be motivated to work when you could save your entire adult life and still struggle be able to afford such “entry level” things as a house or even a new car. People are willing to save and/or hustle for 5-10 years to get material rewards, but beyond that it feels pointless. Why be miserable grinding for two decades just so you can get one hand on the ladder? Instead people look for ways to have a life they find interesting or satisfying now.

“I don’t have goals. I don’t have ambition. I only want to be attractive.”

**Why it matters:** The pandemic-era bull market — now come to an end — was fueled in equal part by YOLO and FOMO.

-   **The former** — "you only live once" — was based on the idea that in a world of zero interest rates, the most likely road to wealth was not a slow accumulation of compound interest, but rather a moonshot that involved gambling everything on a low-probability but ultra-high-return bet.
-   **The latter** — "fear of missing out" — was based on the idea that everybody else was building wealth in the markets, and that if you didn't jump in yourself, you'd lose your best (and possibly only) chance at getting rich.
