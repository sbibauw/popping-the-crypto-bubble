\chapter{Introduction}

Cryptocurrency is a technology based on shifting narratives built around
an ideology to reinvent money from first principles independent of
existing power structures. It has emerged as one of the most intriguing
socio-technical phenomena of the early 21st century. Rarely in the
history of technology has there been any invention that has been the
nexus of discussion along many dimensions of human experience.
Cryptocurrency is a phenomenon that captured the zeitgeist in economics,
technology, politics, law, ethics, culture, and monetary policy.

It is undoubtedly an economic bubble, but on a scale that we have yet to
observe before in human history. The economist Robert Shiller gives us a
framework for understanding this phenomenon in his work Narrative
Economics \cite{shiller_narrative_2017}, which describes the epidemiology of
bubbles that perpetuate "stories that motivate and connect
activities to deeply felt values and needs". Cryptocurrency is
primarily driven by the twenty-first century narrative of distrust in
institutions, yet the undeniable need for the continuity of the
financial services traditionally provided by these financial
institutions. In this critique, we will survey the state of
cryptocurrency, its political imaginaries, and the outcomes it has
achieved in the last decade.

All software is political but some software is more political than
others. Cryptocurrency can best be understood as a reaction to 2008
the global financial crisis and as the synthesis of technolibertarianism
ideology with growing distrust in financial institutions. Within this
context, this technology has influenced the financial services sector and
had a profound influence on popular economic discourse. To this day it
is a technology that remains extremely divisive in its approach to
disruption and its political ends. The divisions on cryptocurrency
divide individuals based on a single philosophical question: Does one
worry more about the abuse of centralized power or does one worry more
about anarchy?

To those that fear anarchy, cryptocurrency is the fantasy of a financial
system free of democratic oversight whose efficacy is based purely on
technology and free-market forces. To those that fear centralized power,
cryptocurrency is a hedge against the overreach and corruption of big
government and a financial services sector whose greed and excesses were
made clear during the financial crisis. This philosophical divide falls
loosely along with existing political ideologies; the cryptocurrency school
is often ideologically adjacent to existing right-wing economic schools
of thought, it is however not entirely contained within that political
sphere. It is a phenomenon that has been co-opted by many individuals
for many ends as a result of its general misunderstanding.

In the "fake it til' you make it\" culture of Silicon Valley, it is
widely accepted to ignore shortcomings of technology until a critical
mass is reached and the benefits can be realized in hindsight.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrency in the present moment has profound
technical, privacy, economic, ethical, and environmental shortcomings
that need to be discussed. The constellation of these shortcomings, lack
of innovation, and potential for vast public harm form the core case
against cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency phenomenon is still
unfolding, and in this text, we aim to give the first rough draft of
history.
